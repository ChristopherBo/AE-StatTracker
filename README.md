## Prerequisites
A copy of Adobe After Effects, preferably from 2018 or newer.

## Installation Method
Download the repo and drop the AE-StatTracker folder in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions\`
Open After Effects and load the extension via Window > Extensions > StatTracker in the top left.

## Usage
Just keep the extension open. You can minimize it, as long as it isn't closed it'll keep tracking. The main page tracks the amount of time you've spent in the current project file.
